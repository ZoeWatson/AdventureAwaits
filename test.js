//And now, the fun begins!

//How to add a new Thing :
//	new Thing(name,contains,name generator);
//		-name is the referral name for this Thing. Unless a name generator is specified, this name will be the default name for any instances of this Thing.
//		-contains is an array of Things that an instance of this Thing contains, specified by their name.
//			-For example, ["banana"] means this Thing contains exactly 1 instance of a banana. ["banana","orange"] means it contains 1 banana and 1 orange.
//			-["banana","strawberry,25%"] means it will contain 1 banana, and has a 25% probability of also containing a strawberry.
//			-["banana,2-7"] means it will contain between 2 and 7 bananas.
//			-[".banana"] will not include a banana in the Thing; instead, the Thing will contain whatever the banana normally contains.
//			-["banana",["sugar","honey"]] will include a banana, and either sugar or honey. Unfortunately, this does not work with the format ".sugar" or ".honey".
//		-name generator is optional; if specified, the instance of the Thing will be named according to this.
//			It can be either an array containing other arrays (the name will be patched up from an element of each array) or an identifier for the Name function, like *BOOK*.
//			A name generator of [["blue ","red "],["frog","toad"]] will produce names such as "blue frog" or "red toad".
